## PART 1/WEEK 1

### What I Learned...

This week was filled with new material! I learned so much more about the "behind the scenes" of a webpage especially when writing meta for an html document. It seemed silly at first that I needed to pour so much energy into an aspect of my site that wouldn't be visible to its users... but this week's lesson proved the importance of a properly structured site. 

### What I Struggled With...

I became a bit frustrated when altering the aesthetic based aspects of my site. It can be upsetting when you're envisioning an idea in your head and can't find the proper code to acheive the visualization! Obviously, the ability to create more visually complex sites will come with time and practice... but the internet is a great resource for enlisting help when you get stuck!

## PART 2/WEEK 2

### What I learned...

This week I learned that the sky is the limit when you are creating your own site from scratch. With enough knowledge there is nothing you can't create. I definitely gained an appreciation for more "complex' websites that I use on a regular basis. Even "simple" websites have a lot more to them than meets the eye. 

### What I Struggled With...

I was overwhelmed with new challenges this week due to the amount of new skills we were expected to apply to our project! Difficulty arose when creating the "forms" page. It just seems that there is a lot of technicalities when developing them, especially when you are unfamilar with the roles that each different type of form plays!

## PART 3/FINAL WEEK

### What I learned...

This week I learned how rewarding it can feel when you create work that you are proud of or surprised you were able to execute. I really enjoyed creating an original video for my site. It challenged me creatively and technically.

### What I struggled with...

I found it a bit difficult to come up with copy for my site. What sounds good in my head may not come across in the same way to site users... I realized it's better to keep the copy simple, clean, and concise.

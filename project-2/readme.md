## PART 1/WEEK 1

### What I Learned...

This week was filled with new material! I learned so much more about the "behind the scenes" of a webpage especially when writing meta for an html document. It seemed silly at first that I needed to pour so much energy into an aspect of my site that wouldn't be visible to its users... but this week's lesson proved the importance of a properly structured site. 

### What I Struggled With...

I became a bit frustrated when altering the aesthetic based aspects of my site. It can be upsetting when you're envisioning an idea in your head and can't find the proper code to acheive the visualization! Obviously, the ability to create more visually complex sites will come with time and practice... but the internet is a great resource for enlisting help when you get stuck!

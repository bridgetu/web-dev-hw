## MY FINAL THOUGHTS ON PROJECT 4

### This assigment felt both freeing and validating. It was the most open ended assignment we've had all semester. At first this was intimidating, but breaking down the project into parts helped this daunting task seem managable. I liked sitting down to sketch "wireframes" and actualize the ideas in my head before diving in to the code.

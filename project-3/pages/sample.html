But children don't have money, only a longing to have fun, so all we need is a stalk of grass and a daisy placed lovingly in a small receptacle foun in the toy drawer. What matters is the love with which the little flower and stalk of grass (that one there in particular and not that other one), are chosen, more than how much there is or how much it costs."</p>

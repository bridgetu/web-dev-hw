WOAH! This week's work has me feeling mentally exhausted in the best way possible. Learning new things is so rewarding! But it can also be completely frustrating and confusing as well. The world of coding is foreign to me, so this week had me feeling like I had jumped in the deep end and was trying to keep my head above water. 

However, I quickly realized that being nervous and unsure would only make the learning process more painful. So I pushed the fear of the unknown aside and starting working through the lesson one step at a time.

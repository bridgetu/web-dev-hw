# My First README.md

## Bridget Unterreiner

WOAH! This week's work has me feeling mentally exhausted in the best way possible. Learning new things is so rewarding! But it can also be completely frustrating and confusing as well. The world of coding is foreign to me, so this week had me feeling like I had jumped in the deep end and was trying to keep my head above water. 

However, I quickly realized that being nervous and unsure would only make the learning process more painful. So I pushed the fear of the unknown aside and starting working through the lesson one step at a time.

### What I Learned...

1. copying and pasting comes in handy when you are writing code! 
1. *snooping* allows you to look at the code for a webpage you find visually pleasing
1. the **"markdown preview"** text editor option is an extremely helpful visual aid

### What I Struggled With...

- navigating GitHub and wrapping my mind around excatly what GitHub's purpose is
- grasping an understanding of "the bigger picture" and not just following each step mindlessly

I had so much fun experimenting with the `Wayback Machine`. I visited [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/) because after recently watching *Girlboss*, a Netflix Original series that tells the story of a young woman that starts an vintage resale store on Ebay in 2006, I was curious how the popular sales site has visually evolved over time.
